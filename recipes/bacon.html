        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the way to get crisp bacon without 
            having to constantly turn it, watch over it, 
            or get burnt by splatters of grease. It 'fries' 
            up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great 
            beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes 
            BLT sandwiches much easier. Very nice when 
            feeding a family or crowd.
        </p>
