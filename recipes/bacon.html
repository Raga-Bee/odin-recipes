        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the way to get crisp bacon without 
            having to constantly turn it, watch over it, 
            or get burnt by splatters of grease. It 'fries' 
            up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great 
            beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes 
            BLT sandwiches much easier. Very nice when 
            feeding a family or crowd.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound thick sliced bacon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degree C). 
            Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange 
            bacon on baking sheet in a single layer with the 
            edges touching or slightly overlapping.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven to desired degree of
                doneness, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove bacon 
                from the baking sheet with tongs or a fork, 
                and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
