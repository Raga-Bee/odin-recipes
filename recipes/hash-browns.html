        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These classic diner-style hash browns are 
            crispy on the outside and fluffy
             on the inside.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled 
                with cold water. Stir until water is cloudy, 
                drain, and cover poataoes again with fresh 
                cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess 
                starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with 
                paper towles, and squeeze out any excess 
                moisture.
            </li>
            <li>Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick 
                pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded 
                potatoes into the hot butter and season 
                with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 
                and paprika.
            </li>
            <li>Cook potatoes until a brown forms on the 
                bottom, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook 
                and stir until potatoes are browned all 
                over, about 5 more minutes
            .</li>
